# Skills.sh Agent Skills Manager

## Skills System Layout (Windows)

Skills are installed as **symlinks**:
- `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` → `~/.agents/skills/<name>/`
- Lock file: `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` — tracks source, hash, timestamps per skill
- `npx skills add` (from skills.sh/Vercel) manages both the symlink and the lock file

### Scanning gotcha
Node.js `Dirent.isDirectory()` returns `false` for symlinks. Use `isSymbolicLink()` + `fs.statSync()` to follow them. See `isDirectoryEntry()` in `src/local/scanner.ts`.

### File watching gotcha
VS Code's `FileSystemWatcher` may not detect content changes through symlinks on Windows. The watcher also monitors `~/.agents/.skill-lock.json` (a regular file) as a reliable fallback for detecting installs and updates.

## Local VSIX Install (Testing)

To build and install the extension locally for testing:

```bash
npm.cmd run build && npx.cmd vsce package --no-dependencies
"/c/Users/abelm/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/bin/code" --install-extension skills-sh-0.1.0.vsix --force
```

Then reload the target VS Code window: **Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"**.

## Windows MINGW64

Use `npm.cmd` not `npm`, `npx.cmd` not `npx` when running commands via Claude Code's Bash tool (MINGW64 shell wrapper issue). The VS Code integrated terminal resolves these correctly on its own — this only applies to Claude's Bash tool.
